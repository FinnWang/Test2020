Dear colleagues, 

Time flies and today is my last working day. I just wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.

It has been a truly rewarding experience working with this team. I've learnt so much and met so many amazing people along the way. I'm truly grateful to have been a part of this journey.

Thank you all for your support, guidance and friendship. Whether it was professional help or just casual chats in the office and coffee, I cherish every moment we shared. 

Although we won't see each other every day, I hope we can keep in touch.
